<p>While a very interesting read, I'm not sure I quite understand the point that Joichi Ito is trying to make. Yes, he offers up various observations about the Internet as we know it, and says many things that people already know. It would seem the only unique point he tries to make is that of relating the Internet as a different context in the word of art forms and communities. I'm not sure how this is a surprise to anyone, as the Internet is still very young. If it were a new nation or state, it would not have a government yet. Sure, the federal government tries to monitor Internet activity, but the amount of theft that occurs, whether one believes in the free Internet or not, clearly shows that there is no governing body on the World Wide Web. Instead, these communities of Internet users are working together to uphold ethics and ideals of how to use such a loosely monitored system. Of course the Internet is a continually changing thing, of course people deal in mediums, and the Internet is its own medium. This medium allowed Alternate Reality Games to surface, with hive minds attacking puzzles on a global scale accross languages and boundaries. A nice culmination of ideas that already exist, with an argument that has always made sense. </p>

<p>It is truly astonishing to read this article in the present, trying to gain an understanding of the Internet as it explains it to be, and then realizing that this article was written 22 years ago. It shows that Tim Berners Lee and his fellow colleagues truly built the web from the ground up as they stated in this article, and even more fascinating in the fact that not a lot has changed. HTML is the standard language as they envisioned it, servers feed things to clients through HTTP requests, and the computer is alive and well. The one thing that struck out to me was in their 'future' section, and the fact that they talk about implementing machine oriented semantic information, something that Tim Berners Lee is still striving for today. Incredible how this document has not only layed out how the internet is going to work in 1994, but it is truly an actual manual into how the web works today in 2016. I'm very curious to hear more about the introduction of this paper, as they stated that somehow the web beat out other hypertext services like Gopher and WAIS, and I'm wondering how this came to be so. Was W3 easier to understand, more practible, and more easily adoptable? What lead to the development of W3 and the abandonment of the other systems? </p>
