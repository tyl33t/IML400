<h3>Aesthetics of the Internet - Joichi Ito</h3>

<p>While a very interesting read, I'm not sure I quite understand the point that Joichi Ito is trying to make. Yes, he offers up various observations about the Internet as we know it, and says many things that people already know. It would seem the only unique point he tries to make is that of relating the Internet as a different context in the word of art forms and communities. I'm not sure how this is a surprise to anyone, as the Internet is still very young. If it were a new nation or state, it would not have a government yet. Sure, the federal government tries to monitor Internet activity, but the amount of theft that occurs, whether one believes in the free Internet or not, clearly shows that there is no governing body on the World Wide Web. Instead, these communities of Internet users are working together to uphold ethics and ideals of how to use such a loosely monitored system. Of course the Internet is a continually changing thing, of course people deal in mediums, and the Internet is its own medium. This medium allowed Alternate Reality Games to surface, with hive minds attacking puzzles on a global scale accross languages and boundaries. A nice culmination of ideas that already exist, with an argument that has always made sense. </p>

<h3>The World-Wide Web - Tim Berners Lee</h3>

<p>It is truly astonishing to read this article in the present, trying to gain an understanding of the Internet as it explains it to be, and then realizing that this article was written 22 years ago. It shows that Tim Berners Lee and his fellow colleagues truly built the web from the ground up as they stated in this article, and even more fascinating in the fact that not a lot has changed. HTML is the standard language as they envisioned it, servers feed things to clients through HTTP requests, and the computer is alive and well. The one thing that struck out to me was in their 'future' section, and the fact that they talk about implementing machine oriented semantic information, something that Tim Berners Lee is still striving for today. Incredible how this document has not only layed out how the internet is going to work in 1994, but it is truly an actual manual into how the web works today in 2016. I'm very curious to hear more about the introduction of this paper, as they stated that somehow the web beat out other hypertext services like Gopher and WAIS, and I'm wondering how this came to be so. Was W3 easier to understand, more practible, and more easily adoptable? What lead to the development of W3 and the abandonment of the other systems? </p>

<h3>Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design - Ben Shneiderman</h3>

<p>Fairly straight forward rules to follow. It is interesting to read the guidelines for a certain aspect of something that applies to other things as well. I feel like these guidelines could almost apply to art, more specifically, film. Some of these just make plain sense when thinking about the user, giving them the easiest, most fun, and most pleasant experience while navigating through a website. However, I do find rule number 8 a little bit contradictory. In the world of business and capitalism, wouldn't you want people to feel trapped in your website to keep them there, perhaps if it was a system for online shopping? While it is true that windows should be simple, reducing short-term memory load doesn't seem like an ideal method of keeping the user in your space, for the simple reason of making money. </p>


<h3>Why Angry Birds is Popular - Charles L. Mauro</h3>

<p>A very interesting analysis on the way that Angry Birds is different from most games. I will admit, when I am playing a game I want it to be fast, otherwise I get impatient and just stop playing. However, with Angry Birds I can see how this idea of patience leads to a more fun and entertaining gaming experience. It is interesting to think that this game is so widely used just because of the fact that it is slower than others, and yet more addictive than most. Is it because it almsot creates this atmosphere of calm laxness, as the user isn't pressured into playing a fast-paced game? The fact that Angry Birds almost makes you slow down is perhaps the reason for why it is so widely addictive. This also feeds into its visual design, with a relaxed, childlike feel that is easy on the eyes and yet very playful and fun. </p>


<h3>Design Principles - Apple OSX Guidelines</h3>

<p>The first thing that came to mind when reading this text was that it had mahy of the elements that Ben Shneiderman talked about in his Eight Rules of Interface Design. It always seems that consistency is the main concept for users, which I would absolutely agree with, as you don't want your user to be confused and feel like they are using several different sites. I would argue, however, that sometimes you might want this effect, to show your user something in a match of form and content. As I believe this design article is about creating applications for users to use, it is interesting to see how some of these apply to web design. Direct manipulation, consistency, etc. all maintain this level of interactivity and user-gravitated visual design. </p>


<h3>User-Centered Design - Apple OSX Guidelines</h3>

<p>This seems to be an overview on the planning part of the process when developing something for a user to experience. Knowing your audience is obviously crucial, and knowing what they want and how you want to give it to them is an excellent part of design. While user testing is often ideal, I find that mostly I'm the one testing out my own products. An excellent plan for moving forward would to get friends or even my parents to test out the things I make and give me feedback, after all I'm not the greatest test subject since I built the thing. It's also interesting to think of the idea of features versus solutions. You can apply this to photoshop or after effects, as a feature may exist that I'm not aware of, but I will use other, more easily available features, to create a solution to the task at hand. </p>


<h3>How Users Read on the Web - Jakob Nielsen</h3>

<p>An excellent, honest, and truthful article in my opinion. It breaks down exactly what people want to see on a web page. It is very true that people hardly read on web pages, and to know exactly what works and what doesn't is very helpful in the world of design. It is obviously all about attracting the attention of your viewer, alerting them to the information they wish to know, not the information you want to give out. Moving forward I won't be writing any long paragraphs without lists or other devices used to make it easier to spot the information my viewers are looking for. </p>

<h3>Virtual Reality</h3>

<p>These articles from The Verge really do illuminate some of the past ideas about Virtual Reality that I had never heard of. While I did know that USC has always been at the forefront of developing virtual reality, I had never heard of the earlier renditions that were attempted 20 to 30 years ago. It is fascinating to me that virtual reality is beginning to gain popularity. While almost all science fiction writers fantasize that the outcome will not be good in any way, the fact that we persue it almost shows the stupidity of mankind. What worries me the most is how soon the reality of life will fade away, becoming uninteresting compared to the variety of entertainment that will become too immersive to ignore. I want my children to play in parks and love nature, not merely look at them through goggles that they slide on to their head, another screen in front of the eyes that doctors insist we already stare at too much. I'm worried about where the future is going, and while sometimes it is cliche to be afraid of change, it really is an interesting question for humanity's relationship to reality, and what it would mean to someday leave it all behind.  </p>

<h3>The Internet as Art - Goran Mijuk</h3>

<p>An interesting article, and one that I assumed existed based on the wide variety of things people are starting to do with coding and the internet. This article touched on something that I think would be neat to see: Web art museums. Screens everywhere, interactive as they are online, a full demonstration of what someone can do with the interent. It only makes sense, as these pieces would be more hands on and fun than a typical museum full of paintings. Think of the field trips that children would go on, seeing the cool things they can do with computers, making them seem not all that boring. The artistic range of the internet is almost more intuitive as well, as you cannot simply pick up a pencil and draw what you what to create, but you must understand the code and the relationship your artwork will have with the browser and the user, on many different platforms. In that way, it is a deeper form of art with more moving pieces, making it even more interesting and influencial, changing its meaning based on the people that view it, how they view it, and how they interact with it. </p>

<h3>Design Research and Critical Making</h3>

<p>The first article, the interview with Don Norman, made a lot of sense, accumulating thoughts that I had noticed and giving them labels. Perhaps the most interesting thing that jumped out at me was the prospect of hearing that he did not believe that people who do design research are never the ones who created radical innovations. This is interesting, and yet makes sense. A design researcher is someone who looks at a product and sees how it works, thus keeping the same dymanics of work in mind as they try to make it more effective. In this way, they will never created something radical because they have already studied something that kind of works and they want to improve it. They would have to learn how to look at something, see how it works, and then try to create the opposite of it, with different intentions in mind. Radical innovation is also difficult to think of, as it relies on an ability to literally see something that was not there before. 
<br>
Open design is an interesting concept, and I can see why people would benefit from the creativity. However, I do not understand where thinking critically comes into this. Is it thought of as a method for open design? Creating while thinking critically to achieve the best outcome, or thinking critically about what the design process means to be truly open? Yes critical making is rare, since you cannot dabble in the art of creative bias while designing, and I would argue that there is no one completely objective to their own work and cannot be extremely critical about it. This article was not informative for someone like me, a low level amature coder, and I do not understand its relavence to the subjects at hand.
