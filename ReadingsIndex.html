<p>While a very interesting read, I'm not sure I quite understand the point that Joichi Ito is trying to make. Yes, he offers up various observations about the Internet as we know it, and says many things that people already know. It would seem the only unique point he tries to make is that of relating the Internet as a different context in the word of art forms and communities. I'm not sure how this is a surprise to anyone, as the Internet is still very young. If it were a new nation or state, it would not have a government yet. Sure, the federal government tries to monitor Internet activity, but the amount of theft that occurs, whether one believes in the free Internet or not, clearly shows that there is no governing body on the World Wide Web. Instead, these communities of Internet users are working together to uphold ethics and ideals of how to use such a loosely monitored system. Of course the Internet is a continually changing thing, of course people deal in mediums, and the Internet is its own medium. This medium allowed Alternate Reality Games to surface, with hive minds attacking puzzles on a global scale accross languages and boundaries. A nice culmination of ideas that already exist, with an argument that has always made sense. </p>
