<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Strengths</h3>

<p>I love to be challenged, and with that comes the love for learning new things. I'm a quick learner with a very positive outlook on life, and a hard worker. Coding HTML and CSS thus far has been a lot of fun, which makes it very enjoyable as a homework assignment. As far as the design aspect goes, I've never been very good at drawing or painting, however I have designed business cards and album covers for clients. Decent at photoshop and any other photo editing software, fairly good understanding of HTML and CSS.</p>

<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Weaknesses</h3>

<p>In the past I haven't been very good at documenting my thought process. After IML 300, I feel like that part of me has improved, although usually I just jump into something and expirement, without thinking about my objective or even writing it down. Not experienced with Illustrator, don't know any JavaScript.  </p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Looking Forward</h3>

<p>In all honesty, I took this class to have fun. I probably won't minor in the IML program, and this isn't really for my major. I've just realized that coding is a lot of fun, and so I took this class to continue coding after IML 300. It would be nice to have more of an understanding as to how JavaScript works, and see other applications of web coding that I haven't even thought of yet. All in all, just looking forward to having fun and learning new things!</p>
