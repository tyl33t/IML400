<p>My new website will have the intention of being used as a portfolio for my creative work moving forward. With lots of big images and a focus on the work explaining itself, there will not be a lot of text or any other things on the page. The viewer's attention must go to the works. It is also for this reason that there is not a navigation bar on every page, as I want the viewer to have to go back and look at the slideshow of works, thus getting exposed to new material everytime they go back to the home page. There will be different links to different areas of the site where people can look at the works I have created. It's intended for anyone curious about what I do, my parents, friends, and even potential companies that are considering me for internships or work. It should leave them with enough information to evaluate my skills, click on another page to learn more about me, and then finally have the means to contact me if necessary. </p>
