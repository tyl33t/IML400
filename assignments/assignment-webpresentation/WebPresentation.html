# An Overview

2007 and 2014 are two different poles of an incredibly transformative era for the web. 
At the beginning, in 2007, you have an Internet still utilizing the technologies and structures of Web 2.0, but also in 2007 you have the first inklings of the social web we know today beginning to pop up. Seven years later, those inklings had grown into a full-blown new generation of web technologies.

There was a transition from basic styling to more contemporary aesthetics.

* Use of visual graphics
* Now highly image and video-based

# Usage Trends

* **"In the decade since Buzzfeed was founded, our computer usage has migrated from desktop to mobile; we've shifted from browsing the web to using apps; and still images are being usurped by live video streams that include chat."**
* In seven years, spurred on by the introduction of the smartphone and the implementation and standardization of responsive HTML5, web content became mobile-centric, and social-heavy. Much of the Internet is now accessed through apps instead of the web, with services like Google struggling to control and index the information held within apps the way they did with the information held within web pages. 
* Between 2007 and 2014, the content ecosystem grew to be able to support thousands and thousands of competing distribution systems, all vying for the worldâ€™s attention through increasing focus on virality, and with a focus on native advertising as the old Web 2.0 methods of banner and click-through advertising quickly lose revenue.
